# Environment Validation

## Sample Code Test
Tested basic Python code and SpeechRecognition library import.

## Speech Recognition Proof-of-Concept
```python
import speech_recognition as sr

recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
with sr.Microphone() as source:
    print("Say something...")
    audio = recognizer.listen(source)
    try:
        text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
        print(f"You said: {text}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

## Core Functionality Proof-of-Concept
- Loaded SpeechRecognition and tested microphone input.
- Recognized speech using Google API.

## Technical Issues Discovered
- Microphone access may require additional permissions on Windows.
- Internet connection required for Google API.
- If `PyAudio` is missing, install with `pip install pyaudio`.
