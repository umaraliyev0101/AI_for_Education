# Educational Content Strategy

## Initial Subject Areas to Support
- Mathematics (K-12)
- Science (Physics, Chemistry, Biology)
- Language Arts (English, Reading Comprehension)
- Computer Science (Programming Basics)
- Social Studies (History, Geography)

*Rationale: These areas cover core curriculum needs and provide a foundation for expanding to other subjects.*

## Knowledge Representation Format
- Use structured formats such as JSON or YAML for content and metadata.
- Each content item includes:
  - Title
  - Subject
  - Grade/Level
  - Learning objectives
  - Content body (text, images, links)
  - Assessment items (questions, answers)
- Example (YAML):
```yaml
- title: "Introduction to Fractions"
  subject: "Mathematics"
  grade: "3"
  objectives:
    - "Understand basic fractions"
  content: "A fraction represents a part of a whole..."
  assessment:
    - question: "What is 1/2 of 8?"
      answer: "4"
```

## Content Organization and Retrieval Methods
- Organize content by subject, grade, and topic hierarchy.
- Use tagging for cross-topic retrieval (e.g., "fractions", "geometry").
- Store content in a database or structured files for fast access.
- Implement search and filter functions in the backend API.
- Support personalized recommendations based on user progress.

## Educational Scaffolding Approach
- Sequence content from simple to complex (spiral curriculum).
- Provide prerequisite checks before advancing to new topics.
- Offer hints, examples, and step-by-step guidance.
- Use formative assessments to gauge understanding and adapt content.
- Encourage mastery learning: allow review and practice until proficiency.

This strategy ensures scalable, adaptive, and effective educational content delivery. Expand subject areas and formats as needed.
