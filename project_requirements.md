# Project Requirements: AI for Education

## Core Features & Must-Haves
- Speech recognition for student input (Vosk)
- Natural language understanding and processing (HuggingFace)
- Interactive educational dashboard (Streamlit)
- User authentication and role management
- Data storage for user progress and content (SQLite)
- Real-time feedback and suggestions
- Support for multiple languages

## Technical Constraints & Limitations
- Must run efficiently on consumer hardware (RTX 2060 Max-Q)
- Offline functionality required for speech and basic NLP
- Use only open-source libraries
- Initial database must be file-based (SQLite)
- UI must be simple and accessible (Streamlit)
- Limit model size to fit in GPU memory

## MVP Success Criteria
- Users can log in and interact with the dashboard
- Speech input is accurately transcribed and processed
- NLP features (summarization, Q&A) work for core subjects
- User progress is saved and retrievable
- System runs locally without cloud dependencies

## Risks & Mitigation Strategies
- **Model accuracy**: Use pre-trained models, allow user corrections
- **Hardware limitations**: Optimize models, provide fallback CPU mode
- **Data privacy**: Store data locally, encrypt sensitive info
- **User adoption**: Design intuitive UI, provide onboarding
- **Library support**: Choose actively maintained libraries, monitor updates
